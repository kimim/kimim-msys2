This is a customized msys2 distro with additional applications for my
daily use. Software and configurations include: mingw64 cli tools,
emacs, texlive, doublecmd, firefox, sumatrapdf, rime, ...

With this repo, I can have a uniform tools over Windows.

The setting up steps:

* Installation

1. install msys2 to anywhere, for example, =C:\Users\kimim\msys64=
2. add customizations from http://github.com/kimim/kimim-msys2
   #+begin_src shell
   cd C:\Users\kimim\msys64
   git init
   git remote add origin http://github.com/kimim/kimim-msys2

   git checkout -t origin/master
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   #+end_src

* Windows Configure
** remap keys

As an Emacs user, I prefer to remmap ~LShift~ to ~LCtrl~ and ~Caps~ to
~LShift~. remap the keys with this ~reg~ file:

[[./kimikit/fix/swapcap.reg]]

** fix inactive title bar color

Inactive Windows title bar background color is light gray, which is
too light in dark theme, so I turn it to dark color with this ~reg~
setting:

[[./kimikit/fix/color.reg]]
